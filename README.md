# 👋 Hi, I’m Nitish Changti

Backend-focused Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience building

I focus on clean, scalable backend architecture, REST APIs, authentication,
and real-time systems. I learn best by building and continuously improving
through practical implementation.

Actively seeking **Fresher / Junior Backend or Full-Stack Developer** roles.
